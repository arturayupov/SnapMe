<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    </ul>
</div>

<h3>1.2 Guest User Data</h3>
<p>If you use the app without creating an account ("Guest Mode"), we assign a unique anonymous identifier to your device to track your daily usage limits (e.g., free generations). This identifier allows you to use the service without providing personal information like email or name.</p>

<h3>1.3 Device Information</h3>
<p>We may collect non-personal device data such as device model, operating system version, app version, and usage statistics for analytics and performance improvement.</p>

<h3>1.4 App Activity</h3>
<p>We collect anonymized information about how you use the app, including interaction events, feature usage, and crash logs. This helps us improve app stability and user experience.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>To generate AI-enhanced photos and artwork based on your uploaded reference images.</li>

    <li><strong>No Third-Party Sharing:</strong> We do not share your face data or original images with third-party data brokers, marketing firms, or any other external parties not directly involved in the generation process.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Original images are stored in your private cloud storage within the app to allow you to reuse them for future generations. They are retained only as long as you maintain your account (or guest session).</li>
